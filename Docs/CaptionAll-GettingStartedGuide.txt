CaptionAll - Getting Started Guide
By Daniel Patterson
Last Revised: 02/06/2026

Introduction
CaptionAll is a high-performance closed-captioning editor designed for speed, precision, and smooth media interaction.
This application was originally written to achieve blazing productivity at perfect quality while creating captions from scratch for video or audio media. Used in conjunction with AI captioning services, CaptionAll is even more useful as a tool for achieving and delivering perfect timing and acuity on every project.

Following are only some of the key capabilities at a glance.

    • Timeline editing.
    • Bubble positioning.
    • Ripple mode.
    • Speed-dial text.
    • Project handling.
    • VTT support.

Understanding the Workspace
CaptionAll's workspace is oriented toward providing a large video preview area and large timer at the top, bordered on the bottom by a caption bubble stream oriented horizontally in a timeline-style.

View Preview
The video preview is the most predominant area of the main form, providing a large, comfortable viewing area.
The video preview automatically sizes to occupy the maximum available space, retaining its original shape at all sizes.


The above image depicts the size of the video preview in a full screen view, while the following image shows the save video preview in a much smaller screen view.



Caption Timeline
The caption timeline is the portion of the editor that displays both the timeline and the caption bubbles in an aligned relationship.
As can be seen in the previous image, there are two horizontal bars in the caption timeline, the timeline bar at the top, and the caption bar at the bottom.

Playhead
The playhead is a small vertical line in the timeline bar indicating the specific active location in time. Click anywhere in the timeline bar to set it.

Selection Area
The selection area is also located in the timeline bar. Following are the mouse behaviors recognized there.
    • Single click. Any selected area is cleared and the playhead pointer is moved to that position. Any selected caption bubbles, if present, remain selected.
    • Click and drag right. The playhead pointer is positioned at the beginning of the selection and the selected area is extended to the point where you release the mouse button.
    • Right-click. Display the caption editing context menu.

Caption Bubbles
Each of the rounded rectangular entries on the caption bar represents a text area. One text entry at a time can be explicitly selected, and the selection state of a text entry can be slightly different than a selected area on the timeline, depending upon the activity.
Following are the mouse behaviors recognized on text objects.
    • Single click. Toggle the selection state of this entry. Text item selection is exclusive. When this item is going from an unselected to a selected state, all of the other entries on the timeline will be unselected.
    • Click and drag near left side of item. Adjust the starting position of the caption, and if present, the ending position of the connected caption to the left.
    • Click and drag near right side of item. Adjust the ending position of the caption, and if present, the starting position of the connected caption to the right.
    • Double-click. Open the Caption Properties dialog on the caption.
    • Right-click. Display the caption editing context menu.

Caption Editing Menus
The caption editing menu is the central focus of tasks and activities while editing anywhere on the caption timeline.
The following commands, available in the caption editing context menu, or in the Edit / Caption and Edit / Selection menus are currently available.
Note that many of the following actions are affected by the status of ripple mode. When ripple mode is off, all changes take place in a local context. When ripple mode is on, in contrast, the results actions can move all items to the right of the affected either right or left. For example, when deleting a 1 second caption with ripple mode turned on, all entries to the right of the deleted item will be shifted to the left by 1 second.
    • Caption Text [F2]. Add or edit caption text at the currently selected area or caption.
    • Caption Width [Ctrl+W]. Adjust the width of the selected caption.
    • Insert Space [Ctrl+Shift+I]. Insert a space into the selected space within a caption or across two captions, splitting the caption(s) into two separated units.
    • Split Caption [Ctrl+I]. Split the caption at the current playhead position into two separate and connected pieces.
    • Toggle Caption | Space [Ctrl+G]. If a caption is selected, that item is converted to a space. Alternatively, if space is selected using the following steps, the space between two captions is converted into a text caption.
        ? Steps to convert space to caption:
            ? Select an area of blank space.
            ? Single click in the blank caption area under the selected range.
            ? Right-click and from the context menu, select Toggle Caption | Space.
    • Remove Space [Ctrl+R]. Remove the space between two captions, joining the end of the right item to the start of the left item.
    • Merge Captions [Ctrl+M]. Merge the contents of two or more captions in the selected area, combining their text.
    • Delete Caption [Ctrl+D]. Delete one or more selected captions.
    • Caption Properties [Ctrl+Enter]. Set the properties of the caption, including position, width, text, and whether to treat this item as a space.
    • Select None [Ctrl+Shift+A]. Clear the selected area and remove any explicit item selection from the selected caption.
    • Select Time from Caption [Ctrl+Shift+T]. Use the currently selected caption as the currently selected range.
    • Snap Caption to Selection [Ctrl+E]. Adjust the start position and width of the caption under the selected range to the start position and width of that range.

Keyboard-Accelerated Workflow
Most command actions have associated keyboard shortcuts, allowing you to accelerate your workflow significantly over other caption editors. See the Keyboard Shortcut List appendix for a complete list of available shortcut keys.

Using Undo
CaptionAll is very forgiving if you change your mind or make a mistake and want to go back a few steps. Any time you want to reverse an action you've made, either press [Ctrl+Z] or select the menu option Edit / Undo (Recent action name).

Projects versus Raw Caption and Media Files
In this application, the project file is a completely separate file, not affecting the caption or media file at all, but allowing you to create and maintain a cross-reference between the caption and media files, allowing them both to be loaded or unloaded simultaneously.
When the changes on a project file are saved, any changes to the caption file are saved along with whatever changes there might have been to the selected media or caption source files since the last save was performed.

A Sample Workflow: Creating and Editing Captions
Possibly the best way to visualize our extremely fast workflow in action is to run through an actual activity where we are going to create the captions from scratch.

Load Your Media
With media loaded, you have more of a visual cue by which to insert your captions. An extremely fast way to define captions for media is to bulk select an entire pulse area, like so.



Preview and Edit a Pulse
Press [Space] to preview the selected audio.
Press [F2] to type in about 34 characters of what you have heard.

Position and Slice
Reposition the playhead to catch the sub-pulse.


Right-click and select Split Caption, or press [Ctrl+I].


Finish the Phrase
Double-click the second caption to edit its text, then press [Enter].



... to result in your first completed audio pulse.


Multiply that by process approximately 100 times and that's about all there is to creating a complete caption file for a media session. Save your caption file on multiple occassions while in progress so a power outage won't spoil your progress.
